Lines and planes: introduction
==============================

Warm up
-------

**Question:** how can we describe the line of intersection of two
planes?

Warm up

**Simpler:** what is the intersection of the planes $x=0$ and $y=0$

-   What is a plane?
-   The plane is perpendicular to the line that is perpendicular to it
    (?!?!!?!)

Quick review

How can you tell if two vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ are
perpendicular?

Quick review

How can you tell if two vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ are
perpendicular?

So how do you write the equation describing "the set of all endpoints of
vectors $\mathbf b$ that are perpendicular to a fixed vector
$\mathbf a$"?

If $\mathbf a=\langle \alpha,\beta,\gamma\rangle$ then the
equation is

$$\alpha x+\beta y+\gamma z = 0.$$

If $\mathbf a=\langle \alpha,\beta,\gamma\rangle$ then the

$$\alpha x+\beta y+\gamma z = 0.$$

Example: if $\mathbf a=\langle 1, 2, -1\rangle$, you get
$x+2y-z=0$.

What shape is that?

Piglet of calculus conjectures
------------------------------

Any plane is just the set of endpoints of vectors perpendicular to a
fixed one! So just fix a vector $\mathbf u$ and let

$$P_{\mathbf u}=\{\mathbf v\textrm{ such that }\mathbf
v\cdot\mathbf u=0\}.$$

For example, the $xy$-plane is the set of endpoints of vectors
perpendicular to $\langle 0,0,1\rangle$

Does it work? Can the piglet of calculus go to sleep now?

Conundrum: translation
----------------------

-   This is OK if the plane can be anchored like vectors can at
    $(0,0,0)$.
-   If not, we have to take what we just did and translate it in space
    (i.e., move it away from $(0,0,0)$).
-   This is just like making the plane $z=4$ by translating the
    $xy$-plane up $4$ units: the plane $z=4$ is **not** the set of
    **endpoints** of vectors perpendicular to $\mathbf k$, just a
    parallel **translation** of it.
