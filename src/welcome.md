# Welcome

We are excited to have you with us for online Math 126! This site is in
constant development as we move our whole operation to a flexible open-source framework. Look for improvements every day. Visit our
[GitHub site](https://github.com/maxlieblich/math126), feel free to open new
issues, send us pull requests, etc. The old materials, including videos
accompanying the original slides, are all available
[here](http://www.math.washington.edu/~lieblich/Math126/all.html). You will find the material on this site to be somewhere between spare lecture notes and the longer explanations in your book. Use all of the resources! (We will add more here as we accumulate them.)
