<p>Nedwina has defective ankles, but like a true Seattleite she has decided to climb Mt. Rainier. Her doctor says she cannot walk on any surface whose angle with the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane is greater than <span class="math">\(\pi/3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Nedwina knows a nerd who modeled her favorite part of Rainier by the equation <span class="math">\(x^3+z^2(y^2+y^3)+x+y+z=0.\)</span></p>
<p>Can Nedwina stand at the point <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span> without violating her doctor's orders?</p>
<p>What is the best linear approximation to the surface around the point <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span>?</p>
<h2 id="heres-the-model-with-000-indicated">Here's the model with <span class="math">\((0,0,0)\)</span> indicated</h2>

<p>Find the tangent plane to the paraboloid <span class="math">\(z=x^2+y^2\)</span> at the point <span class="math">\((1,1,2)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="a-silly-observation">A silly observation</h2>
<p>If we slice the whole package with a plane, we go from a surface and tangent plane to a curve and tangent line!</p>
<h2 id="partial-derivatives-1">Partial derivatives</h2>
<p>This process of restricting attention to one variable and taking derivatives &quot;with respect to that variable&quot; is called taking partial derivatives.</p>
<p>Formal definition: given a function of two variables <span class="math">\(f(x,y)\)</span>, the partial derivatives with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> at a point <span class="math">\((a,b)\)</span> are defined as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=f_x(a,b)=\lim_{h\to
0}\frac{f(a+h,b)-f(a,b)}{h}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=f_y(a,b)=\lim_{h\to
0}\frac{f(a,b+h)-f(a,b)}{h}\]</span></p>
<p>Rules</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat one variable as a constant</li>
<li>Differentiate with respect to the other one</li>
<li>Rejoice</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, consider the function <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\)</span>. To compute the partial derivative with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, we treat <span class="math">\(y\)</span> as a constant and do the usual one-variable differentiation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=2x.\]</span></p>
<p>Do some! Compute the partial derivatives with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> of these functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=\sin(x)\cos(y)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=x^y\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(f(x,y)=y^5\)</span></li>
</ul>
