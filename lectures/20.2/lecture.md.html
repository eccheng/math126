<h1 id="center-of-mass">Center of mass</h1>
<h2 id="question" class="question">Question</h2>
<p>Nedwina enjoys eating roadkill. She has found a squashed squirrel in the shape of the unit square centered at the origin in the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane; its density at a point <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> is <span class="math">\(e^{x+y}\)</span>. In order to cook the squirrel correctly, Nedwina has to balance it on the top of a narrow stick. How should she lay the flat and rigid squirrel on the stick?</p>
<p>Re-phrase: where is the center of mass of the flattened squirrel?</p>
<p>Here is a representation in which the intensity of color is proportional to the density <span class="math">\(e^{x+y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Where do you guess the center of mass will be?</p>
<h2 id="computing-center-of-mass">Computing center of mass</h2>
<p>Let's suppose we have a planar lamina <span class="math">\(D\)</span> with a function <span class="math">\(\rho(x,y)\)</span> describing the density of the lamina at a point <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Just like in Math 125, we compute the center of mass by dividing the moments around the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> axes by the mass. In integrals, the location <span class="math">\((\overline x,\overline y)\)</span> of the center of mass will be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\overline
x=\frac{\iint_Dx\rho(x,y)dA}{\iint_D\rho(x,y)dA}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\overline
y=\frac{\iint_Dy\rho(x,y)dA}{\iint_D\rho(x,y)dA}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="in-our-case">In our case</h2>
<p>Writing it out for Nedwina's squirrel:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\overline
x=\frac{\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}xe^{x+y}dxdy}{\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}e^{x+y}dxdy}=\frac{3-e}{2e-2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[\overline
y=\frac{\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}ye^{x+y}dxdy}{\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}e^{x+y}dxdy}=\frac{3-e}{2e-2}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="yum" style="position:relative;top:2.4em;color:#00cc00"><em>Yum!</em></h2>
<h2 id="do-one">Do one!</h2>
<p>A steam roller comes by and runs over the squirrel. The poor thing now occupies the square <span class="math">\([-1,1]\times[-1,1]\)</span> with density function <span class="math">\(\rho(x,y)=\alpha e^{x+y}\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is a constant that keeps the total mass constant; find it if you feel like it).</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the new center of mass?</li>
<li>Suppose this procedure repeats so that the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th time the steam roller runs over the squirrel the square becomes <span class="math">\([-2+e^{-n},2-e^{-n}]\times [-2+e^{-n},2-e^{-n}]\)</span> and the density becomes <span class="math">\(\rho(x,y)=\alpha_n e^{x/n+y/n}\)</span> (for an appropriate constant <span class="math">\(\alpha_n\)</span> to keep the mass constant). What is the limiting position of the center of mass as <span class="math">\(n\to\infty\)</span>?</li>
</ul>
